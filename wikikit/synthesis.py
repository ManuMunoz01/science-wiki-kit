"""Living-synthesis layer: the write gate (V1-V5) and the block writer.

The "## State of Knowledge" block of a concept or method note restructures findings the note
already carries. This module holds the two deterministic pieces around it:

  validate()      the write gate. Five mechanical checks, no judgement:
                    V1 source fabrication   a source the block cites is not used anywhere in the note
                    V2 number fabrication   a number in the block's prose is not in the note body
                    V3 zero information loss  a `Controversies or Gaps` link does not reach the block
                    V4 pre-fulltext flagging  an entry cites a pre-fulltext paper without a warning glyph
                    V5 format               header with `updated <date>`; every bullet has a state glyph
  insert_block()  place a validated block after `## Definition` (or `## Description`) and absorb
                  `## Controversies or Gaps` by RETITLING it, never deleting it.

Why absorbing retitles instead of deleting: V2 requires every figure in the block to be anchored in
the note BODY, and the gate runs before the write, while the section still exists. Deleting the
section strands any figure that lived only there: the block passes V2 at write time and violates it
a second later. Retitling keeps every line where it was, so the invariant holds by construction.
The block is the living verdict; the body is the store that anchors it.
